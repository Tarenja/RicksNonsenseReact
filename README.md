# Rick's Biographical Nonsense (React)

Using the Rick & Morty API (rickandmortyapi.com) display the profiles of the characters (either
with pagination or showing the first page only).

The profile of a character should include:

* Image
* Character information (name, species, etc).
* Origin and location information (name, dimension, amount of residents, etc).
* Name of the chapters the character is featured on.

The API provides REST and GraphQL versions, for this exercise you should use the REST
version.

You are free to use any library/framework or even language. Be ready to explain the rationale
for your choices.

The exercise can be submitted in and online environment (we prefer codesandbox.io), a public
repository or a zip file. If you choose any of the last two options make sure that running your
solution requires no global dependencies (besides node/npm/yarn) and it's possible to run it with
only one command (besides yarn/npm install).

Write the code with production standards in mind.


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
